# nousReviewApp

Welcome to nousReview!

nous Review is an Android application that enables you to view (already added) 3d .obj models and since you turn into edit mode you can specify any mistakes to be corrected and send it as an image to your colleagues. It is ideal for a 3d animation/video game production pipeline. 

Important note: You can enter the application only through Facebook login and the access is only permitted for the "nous Animation" crew. You can modify this restriction through the "LogIn Activity".

This application was awarded among the 10 best Android applications of the 2017-2018 class of Applied Informatics in University of Macedonia.
